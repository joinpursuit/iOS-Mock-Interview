## Personal Pitch

Tell me about yourself

## Questions

What is the definition of a higher-order function?

*Higher order functions are simply functions that operate on other functions by either taking a function as an argument, or returning a function.*

Explain Delegation

*Delegates are a design pattern that allows one object to send messages to another object when a specific event happens.*

## Behavioral

Give me an example of a time when priorities were shifted on you. How did you react?

Tell me about a team project that you worked on.

### Pair Sum

Given an array of integers, return all unique element pairs that sum up to a specified value k. List the pairs in [min, max] order.

Clarify if asked:

Aim for better than O(n^2), you can do it!
Tips:

What would the O(n^2) approach look like?
Is there a data structure you can use to improve the time complexity?


```swift
func pairSum(arr: [Int], target: Int) -> [[Int]] {
    var pairDictionary = [Int:Int]()
    var pairs = [[Int]]()

    for i in arr {
        let difference = target - i
        if let value = pairDictionary[i] {
            if i > value {
                pairs.append([value,i])
                } else {
                pairs.append([i,value])
            }
        } else {
            pairDictionary[difference] = i
        }
    }
    
    return pairs
}

```


### Matrix Area Sum

Given a matrix of integers and the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangular area within the matrix, find the sum of numbers falling inside the rectangle.

Example:
```
# matrix
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 0 1 2

sumMatrix(matrix, [1, 1], [3, 2]) //=> 24

Row/column indices are inclusive (`sumMatrix(matrix, [1, 2], [3, 2])` will
  include the element at (3, 2)
```

```swift
func sumMatrix(matrix: [[Int]], topLeft: [Int], bottomRight: [Int]) -> Int {
    var sum = 0
    
    for i in topLeft[0]...bottomRight[0] {
        for j in topLeft[1]...bottomRight[1]{
            print(j,i)
            sum += matrix[j][i]
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```
