## Personal Pitch

Tell me about your background.

## Questions

What's the difference between nil and .none?

*There is no difference, as Optional.none (.none for short) and nil are equivalent.*

What is a generic and what problem does it solve?

*In Swift, you can use generics in both functions and data types, e.g. in classes, structures or enumerations.
Generics solve the problem of code duplication. When you have a method that takes one type of parameter, it's common to duplicate it to accommodate a parameter of a different type.*

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time you worked effectively under pressure and how you were able to do so.

Have you handled a difficult situation with a co-worker? How?

## White Board

### String Compression

For each character in a string log the character and the count in a compressed format. Exp compress("aaabbcca") // => "a3b2c2a1"

```Swift
func compress(_ string: String) -> String {
    var output = ""
    var count = 0
    
    for i in 0..<string.count {
        count += 1
        
        //handle breaking out of range and the last value
        guard i + 1 != string.count else {
            //check if last value is part of the pattern or a single different character
            if string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i)] != string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i - 1)] {
                
                output += "\(string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i)].description)1"
            } else {
                output += string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i)].description + count.description
            }
            return output
        }
        
        //compare current character with the one next to it
        if string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i)] != string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i + 1)] {
            //if different, add to the output and reset count
            output += string[string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: i)].description + count.description
            count = 0
        }
    }
    return output
}
```


### Duplicates

Write a function that takes an array of Ints and returns its duplicate values.

Examples:

duplicates([2,2,1,4]) // => [2]

duplicates([]) // => []


Hints:

What type of collection has constant lookup/set methods?

Follow-up Questions:
What if we want to preserve the order of our dupes?


```swift
func duplicates(_ arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var output = Set<Int>()
    var dups = Set<Int>()
    
 
    arr.forEach { 
        if dups.contains($0) {
            output.insert($0)
        } else {
            dups.insert($0)
        }
    }
    
    return Array(output)
}

```
