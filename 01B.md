### Transformable

Given two strings, return whether the second can be transformed into the first by removing characters.

Ex. aabbaa can be transformed into aba by removing a, b, and a

Clarifications:

We can assume str2 always has greater or equal length than str1

Hints:

What if str1 is an empty string?
Start with the case where str1 == str2 and then build up


```swift

func transformable (_ str1: String, _ str2: String) -> Bool {
    guard !str1.isEmpty else { return false }
    var frequency = [Character:Int]()
    
    //get frequency for second string
    str2.forEach {
        if let value = frequency[$0] {
            frequency[$0] = value + 1
        } else {
            frequency[$0] = 1
        }
    }
    
    //check all the needed letters are in the frequency, and decrease frequency on each visit. if not there or goes under 0, return false
    
    for i in str1 {
        if let value = frequency[i] {
            guard value != 0  else { return false }
            frequency[i] = value - 1
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    //all needed letters are found, return true
    return true
}


```


### Goofy Years

Write a function that takes a year and returns an array with the 10 closest subsequent years that meet the following condition: the first two digits summed with the last two digits are equal to the middle two digits.

Clarify if asked:

Year is a four digit integer
Examples:
1978 => 19 + 78 = 97
2307 => 23 + 07 = 30

``` swift
func goofyYears(_ year: Int) -> [Int] {
    var years = [Int]()
    var current = year
    
    //keep checking the next year until you get the first 10 values
    while years.count != 10 {
        current += 1
        
        //helper function to determine if it is a goofy year
        if isGoofyYear(current.description) {
            years.append(current)
        }
    }
    return years
}


//break pieces apart using an array and test the math
func isGoofyYear(_ year: String) -> Bool {
    let current = Array(year)
    guard let firstTwo = Int("\(current[0])\(current[1])"), let middleTwo = Int("\(current[1])\(current[2])"), let lastTwo = Int("\(current[2])\(current[3])") else { return false }
    return firstTwo + lastTwo == middleTwo
}
```
