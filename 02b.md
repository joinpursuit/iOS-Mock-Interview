## Personal Pitch

Give some information about yourself.

## Questions

### 1. Summarize the main differences between a structure and a class.

Classes support inheritance; structures don't. Classes are reference types; structures are value types.

### 2. What is the difference between Synchronous & Asynchronous task?

Synchronous: waits until the task have completed

Asynchronous: completes a task in the background and can notify you when complete

## Behavioral

1. Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.

2. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.

## White Board

### Spiral Order

Given a square matrix in the form of a 2D array-of-arrays, return an array consisting of the values of the array in "spiral order" (top row, then right hand side, then bottom in reverse, then up, the back again...).

Exp: [[1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
      ]

    // => [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
    
Approach:

Keep track of the left, right, top and bottom bounds.

1. Visit every element in the first row then increment top so we don't visit any items in the first row.
2. Visit every element in the right most column then increment right so we don't visit any items in the right most row.
3. Visit every element in the bottom row then increment bottom so we don't visit any items in the bottom row.
4. Visit every item in the left most column then increment left so we don't visit any items in the left most column.
5. Repeat.

```swift
func spiralOrder(_ matrix: [[Int]]) -> [Int] {
    guard matrix.count > 0 else {
        return []
    }

    let n = matrix.count
    let m = matrix[0].count
    var left = 0
    var right = m - 1
    var top = 0
    var bottom = n - 1

    var result: [Int] = []

    for _ in 0..<n * m {
        for i in left...right {
            result.append(matrix[top][i])
        }
        top += 1
        if (top > bottom) { break }

        for i in top...bottom {
            result.append(matrix[i][right])
        }
        right -= 1
        if (left > right) { break }

        for i in stride(from: right, through: left, by: -1) {
            result.append(matrix[bottom][i])
        }
        bottom -= 1
        if (top > bottom) { break }

        for i in stride(from: bottom, through: top, by: -1) {
            result.append(matrix[i][left])
        }
        left += 1
        if (left > right) { break }
    }

    return result
}
```

### Sum Rec
Write a function that takes an array of integers and recursively computes the sum.

Clarify if needed:

Time complexity should be O(n)

Hints

What is the base case?
What is the result of sumRec([])?
How can we avoid creating a new array each time?


```swift

func sumRec(arr:[Int], i: Int = 0) -> Int {
    guard i < arr.count else { return 0 }
    return arr[i] + sumRec(arr: arr,i: i+1)
}

```
